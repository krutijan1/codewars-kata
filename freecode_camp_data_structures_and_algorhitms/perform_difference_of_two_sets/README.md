***Data Structures: Perform a Difference on Two Sets of Data***
In this exercise we are going to perform a difference on 2 sets of data. We will create a method on our Set data structure called difference. A difference of sets should compare two sets and return the items present in the first set that are absent in the second. This method should take another Set as an argument and return the difference of the two sets.

```javascript
For example, if setA = ['a','b','c'] and setB = ['a','b','d','e'], then the difference of setA and setB is: setA.difference(setB) = ['c'].
```
