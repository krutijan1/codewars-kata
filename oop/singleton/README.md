In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Create an Singleton pattern, so there is one object in system.

Example:

```javascript
var obj1 = new Singleton();
var obj2 = new Singleton();
obj1 === obj2; // => true
obj1.test = 1;
obj2.test; // => 1
````
