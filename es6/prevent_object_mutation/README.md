***ES6: Prevent Object Mutation***

As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Once the object is frozen, you can no longer add, update, or delete properties from it. Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected without an error.

```javascript
let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad"; //will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
obj.newProp = "Test"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
console.log(obj); 
// { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review:"Awesome"}
```

In this challenge you are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the MATH_CONSTANTS object so that no one is able alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties .
