***ES6: Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function***

ES6 provides a new syntax to help create objects, using the keyword class.

This is to be noted, that the class syntax is just a syntax, and not a full-fledged class based implementation of object oriented paradigm, unlike in languages like Java, or Python, or Ruby etc.

In ES5, we usually define a constructor function, and use the new keyword to instantiate an object.

```javascript
var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
}
var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

The class syntax simply replaces the constructor function creation:

```javascript
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet){
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

Notice that the class keyword declares a new function, and a constructor was added, which would be invoked when new is called - to create a new object.


Use class keyword and write a proper constructor to create the Vegetable class.

The Vegetable lets you create a vegetable object, with a property name, to be passed to constructor.
