***ES6: Use the Rest Operator with Function Parameters***

In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces the rest operator for function parameters. With the rest operator, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

Check out this code:

```javascript
function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2)); // You have passed 3 arguments
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { })); // You have passed 4 arguments.
```

The rest operator eliminates the need to check the args array and allows us to apply map(), filter() and reduce() on the parameters array.


Modify the function sum so that it uses the rest operator and it works in the same way with any number of parameters.
