***Algorithms: Find the Symmetric Difference***

Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of the symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of the provided arrays.

Given two sets (for example set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {2, 3, 4}), the mathematical term "symmetric difference" of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets, but not in both (A △ B = C = {1, 4}). For every additional symmetric difference you take (say on a set D = {2, 3}), you should get the set with elements which are in either of the two the sets but not both (C △ D = {1, 4} △ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}). The resulting array must contain only unique values (no duplicates).

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
