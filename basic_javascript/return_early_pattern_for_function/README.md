***Basic JavaScript: Return Early Pattern for Functions***

When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.

Example

```javascript
function myFun() {
  console.log("Hello");
  return "World";
  console.log("byebye");
}
myFun();
```

The above outputs "Hello" to the console, returns "World", but "byebye" is never output, because the function exits at the return statement.


Modify the function abTest so that if a or b are less than 0 the function will immediately exit with a value of undefined.

Hint
Remember that undefined is a keyword, not a string.
