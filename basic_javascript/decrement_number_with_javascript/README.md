***Basic JavaScript: Decrement a Number with JavaScript***

You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

```javascript
i--;

is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;
```

Note
The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.


Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.
