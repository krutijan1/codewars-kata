***Basic JavaScript: Constructing Strings with Variables***

Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.


Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"
