***Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation***

The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

```javascript
var myObj = {
"Space Name": "Kirk",
"More Space": "Spock",
"NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};
myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj['More Space']; // Spock
myObj["NoSpace"]; // USS Enterprise
```

Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

Read the values of the properties "an entree" and "the drink" of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.
