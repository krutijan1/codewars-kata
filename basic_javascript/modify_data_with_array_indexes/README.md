***Basic JavaScript: Modify Array Data With Indexes***

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.

Example

```javascript
var ourArray = [50,40,30];
ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]
```

Note
There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.


Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.
