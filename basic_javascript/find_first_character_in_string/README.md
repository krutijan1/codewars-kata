***Basic JavaScript: Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String***

Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using 

```javascript
firstName[0].
```

Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.

Hint
Try looking at the firstLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.
