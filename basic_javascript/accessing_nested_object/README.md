***Basic JavaScript: Accessing Nested Objects***

The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.

Here is a nested object:

```javascript
var ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};
ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2; // "secrets"
ourStorage.desk.drawer; // "stapler"
```

Access the myStorage object and assign the contents of the glove box property to the gloveBoxContents variable. Use bracket notation for properties with a space in their name.
